 Project Overview:
This project is a Library Management System â€” a web application that simplifies and automates library operations. It supports both librarians and library members by streamlining book tracking, member registrations, and borrowing records.

Key Features Demonstrated in the Video:

Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionality for books, members, and borrowing records

 Automated late fee calculation when books are returned late

 Real-time book availability status

 Duplicate member prevention using stored procedures

 Reports for overdue books and active checkouts

 Tech Stack:

ASP.NET Core MVC

Entity Framework Core

SQL Server

C#

HTML & Razor Views

What I Learned:
One major challenge was getting the form submissions to work correctly using model binding and validation. I overcame this by carefully debugging my controller logic, adding proper view bindings, and using anti-forgery tokens.
Standout Feature:
The automated late fee calculation feature dynamically updates fees based on due dates and return status, reducing manual tracking for librarians.
